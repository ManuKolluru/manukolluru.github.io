    <p>The goal of our data visualization project was to investigate the development of and changes in carbon emissions in the United States since 1990
       as well as present these developments for viewers to examine and interact with in a quick and intuitive way.  Considering the public issue
       of climate change in the past few decades, this set of data visualizations will allow viewers to see how the United States is pogressing or
       digressing in the pursuit of decreasing carbon emissions.</p>

    <p>Our first visualization introduces the changes in the past 50 years concerning the trends of carbon emissions in the United States.  Some
       states have had increases in carbon emissions while others have had decreases.  This visualization allows viewers to hover over each state
       on the map and investigate the greatest increases in the country, the greatest decreases in the country, or even the results of their home
       state.

    <p>Our second visualization expands upon the the first vizualization to allow viewers to dig deeper into the changes in carbon emissions in the
       United States over time, allowing viewers to inspect every state's total carbon emissions each year from 1990 to 2017 and see how they have
       progressed or digressed.

    <p>Finally, our third graph provides a palpable, national view of carbon emissions through the lens of how many millions of metric tons of carbon
       emissions were produced in different sectors.  With the moving visualization, viewers will be able to see the how components of the total amount
       of carbon emissions compare to each other and how much the United States relies on fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal in several aspects
       of daily life.
